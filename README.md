# Available Hound Data

## What
A demo app to focus on bringing data in, displaying as a table, and on row-click display a separate card or expand as accordion.

What this demo covers:
- Filtering (select on mobile & button on desktop)
- Sorting with animation
- Table row interactions (click, expand, highlight)
- Portals/modals
- Data fetching patterns
- Custom hooks (after refactor)

Buttons in the header allow for options: 
- accordion or modal mode: when the user clicks a row, will the extra info show as a modal or an expanded drawer?
- dots on horizontal: the slideshow defaults to dots on mobile and arrows on horizontal (900px). This allows for dots to also be on horizontal. There is no option for arrows at mobile. I could, but as a user, I hate that UI, so ... my repo; my rules.

## Why
Just to have as a reference and it's kind of fun to play around with options, filter, and sorting. The data is hardcoded from the GALT website, so it is not current. 

## Who
... was my latest foster? Zoey (now Pepper). Important for a README? Probably not, but she was the best foster and I want to see her face foreverrrrr.

## How
- Vite
- React
- Data comes from galtx.org but not by way of scraping--just my tippy tappy typing
