# Available Hound Data

## What
A showcase app to focus on bringing data in, displaying as a table, and on row-click display a separate card or expand as accordion.

## Why
Just to have as a reference and it's kind of fun to play around with options. The data is hardcoded from the GALT website, so it is not current. 

## Who
... was my latest foster? Zoey (now Pepper). Important for a README? Probably not, but she was the best foster and I want to see her face foreverrrrr.

## How
- Vite
- React
- Data comes from galtx.org but not by way of scraping--just my tippy tappy typing
