This girl is such a pleasure and so far has shown no diva tendencies. Is that because she doesn't have to share our attention with other dogs? Maybe. All I can say is she is easy-peasy to love and care for.`,

Unfortunately the animals at the residence were not welcoming and a Facebook plea was put out. GALT Good Samaritans took her in.\n\nNollie, aka Nollie Cannoli, is a sweet little girl with a big heart. She has so much love to give! She is a velcro dog that will follow you wherever you go, just in case you might need assistance. She will be so excited to see you that she will demonstrate her awesome spin moves, sometimes incorporating a jump and spin for show. She will give you all the cuddles, as long as your hand continues to pet her. Otherwise, she'll gladly curl up and take a nap anywhere, as long as it's in the same room as you.\n\nDue to her past abandonment, she will enjoy a household with a regular routine and a furry friend for companionship when you are not at home. While Nollie didn't have a reaction to kittens she met, she has not lived with cats. She is crate trained, so much so that she'll stay in the crate all night with the door closed but unlocked, until she knows it's time to come out (about 7am). She's not a fan of toys and much prefers time with her humans. She has also been known to tell on her foster siblings when they play. She's timid to join in so she barks from afar instead. She always wants to be the center of attention, and often doesn't wait her turn for pets and praise.`,

He catches everyone's eye that meets him as he is one handsome hound.\n\nNico got so much of the best of all of his breeds makeup, he got the sweet goofiness of the Irish Wolfhound, the tall elegance of the Borzoi, and the calm content disposition of the greyhound. His forever family is going to be quite lucky to call this boy their own. His ideal forever home will have a yard to spend time together in, a tall secure enclosure (he's still athletic for a senior), and Nico prefers the company of women, to a fault.`,
